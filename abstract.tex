\section*{Abstract}
The fixed-width confidence interval (FWCI) estimation problems for a normal mean when the variance is unknown have moved along under a zero-one loss without taking into account sampling cost. While, minimum risk point estimation (MRPE) problems have grown largely under squared error loss (SEL) plus sampling cost. Here, a new formulation combining
both MRPE and FWCI methodologies is introduced with desired asymptotic second-order characteristics under a unified structure to develop a minimum risk fixed-width confidence interval (MRFWCI) strategy.
